Xamarin.Forms + MvvmCross
=============

Just a demo showing Xamarin.Forms working with MvvmCross.

This demo uses TMDB to get a list of movies the user searches for, each movie can be shown with details.

It uses ListView, Image, Label, Button and other controls from Xamarin.Forms, and these are bound to ViewModels created with MvvmCross.

It also provides an MvvmCross implementation for the Android and iOS platform, to use Xamarin.Forms with it, this includes  custom Presenters and Activities. This code is based on the [Mvx-Books code](https://github.com/xamarin/quickui-beta/tree/master/Mvx-Books) (private repo, thanks [Stuart](https://github.com/slodge)!
